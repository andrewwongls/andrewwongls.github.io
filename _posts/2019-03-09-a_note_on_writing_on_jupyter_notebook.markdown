In the course of 5 weeks, I have read countless Jupyter Notebook (Okay, since we are talking about data here, it is roughly about 150 Jupyter Notebook). There are some best practices that I have tried myself. Here's some tips for you my dear reader.

**First, get to know Jupyter Notebook markup at the back of your hand.**
<br>
Here are some examples of the power of Juptyer Notebook

Cell Tabbing
Column Configuration
Header Cells
Linking
Automatic Section Numbering and Table of Contents Support
Automatic Section Numbering
Table of Contents Support
Using Both Automatic Section Numbering and Table of Contents Support
Keyboard Shortcuts
Paragraph Breaks
Line Breaks
Soft-Wrapping
Hard-Wrapping
Headers
Standard Block Quoting
Nested Block Quoting
Ordered Lists
Bulleted Lists
Reference Links
Images from the Internet
LaTeX Math
Creating a Bibtex Database
External Bibliographic Databases
Internal Bibliographic Databases
Hiding Your Internal Database
Turning Your Jupyter Notebook into a Slideshow

Here's the link to get the exact common on Markup (https://jupyter.brynmawr.edu/services/public/dblank/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Users%20Manual.ipynb#4.-Using-Markdown-Cells-for-Writing)

**Second, guide the reader through a journey with marker.**
<br>
A diagram with steps that show the reader from start to end will be a great start.


**Third, be consistent to presenting your argument.**
<br>
A case in point, if you have run 4 hypothesis testing with t-test or cohen's d, it will be better to have consistent python command that produces similar formatted results (of course, the t-values will be different, in this case).

**Fourth, it will be of value if we can provide a "So, what" into everyone key statement or analysis**
<br>
This is important because the reader wants the linkage between your computation and analysis (seriously they really wants to know, I am one of them). Please don't let them hanging dry.

**Fifth, round things up with conclusion.**
<br>
After scrolling down or spending time (hopefully, good quality time) reading through your Jupyter Notebook, you should be kind to your reader to summarize what have been discussed. Wouldn't that will be nice?

There are many more tips, and I will add. Stay tuned.
