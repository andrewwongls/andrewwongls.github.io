This is all about happenstance. 
First, I was reading an article on New York Times about Professor George Hinton discovering new way of doing Machine Learning. I was like, whoa, new discovery still happening! Great, loving it. See this great article here (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/technology/artificial-intelligence-research-toronto.html)

A New Way for Machines to See, Taking Shape in Toronto - The New York Times - The New York Times - Breaking News, World News & Multimedia
One of the pioneers of so-called computer vision is working on ways to deal with issues his old ideas could not solve.

Second, stumbled upon Flatiron School. And going through few short modules. I love it. I am very text-based learner rather than video-based. And, I was thinking/ telling myself after a few days of thinking about future. This is it. I am going for it.

Now on the specific question of why becoming a data scientist. 

Perhaps the romantic notion of being in the flow, just doing statistics and coding. Headset on.
Perhaps the aspiration notion of being a data scientist.
Perhaps the advancing-human-knowledge notion. That's a big leap!
Perhaps the struggle. I love to struggle.

I don't know yet because I am still not a machine learning expert, I am still a learning machine (human)
